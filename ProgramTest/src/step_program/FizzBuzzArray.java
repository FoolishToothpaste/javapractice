/**A program FizzBuzz that take a number as user input and if it is a positive integer loops from 0 to the number and saves the number, but for multiples of 3 saves "Fizz" instead of the number, for multiples of 5 saves "Buzz", and for multiples of both saves "FizzBuzz" and finally, prints the array results for each index position in the format Position 1 = 1, â€¦, Position 3 = Fizz,...*/
